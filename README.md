## Algorithms🚧 🚧(In-Progress)🚧🚧

This Repository contains implementation to common or any interesting algorithms with Kotlin and their analysis.

Each module represents a subset of different types/forms of algorithms

To Contribute to this repository e.g  adding a set of algorithms classified under dynamic programming
- Create the module ```Dynamic Programming``` with ``src`` directory containing the algorithm(s) implementation each with their own class/file and ``test`` directory for tests related to the algorithm.
This follows the default java project structure.

Or

- If the module to your algorithm exists add it under src in its own file/class with a corresponding test

or

- If your algorithm does not fit in any module or type of algorithm place it under the ```Other``` module with corresponding test

The documentation will iterate and improve over the course of development and is a chance for first time contributors to get their
hands dirty with open source contributions.

Thank you for your contribution.
