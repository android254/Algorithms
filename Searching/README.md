## Searching Algorithms

Searching Algorithms are used to find or retrieve an element from where it is stored in a given data structure.
This can be either  __Sequential__ or __Interval__ based.

1. **Linear Search**

This is a sequential search,it works by comparing the input in which you are searching against all elements in the data structure
starting from the first element to the last and will stop if it encounters a match midway.


__Best Case Scenario__ : 0(1) - this is when the item is found on the first try

__Worst Case Scenario__: 0(n) - this can be cases where the input is not in the list or is at the very end of the list.

__Average Case Scenario__: 0(n)
